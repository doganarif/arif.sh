Launching liftOS last month was a monumental milestone for my co-founder, Ege, and me. As the founders of this ambitious project, we've immersed ourselves in every aspect of the business—meetings, development (my favorite part), team management, and constant communication. However, the journey has been a mix of exhilarating achievements and grueling challenges.

## The Launch and the 24/7 Grind

Since the launch, Ege and I have taken on the role of customer support, quite literally around the clock. Waiting for customer queries at 3 AM was one of the hardest things I've experienced. This relentless schedule taught me the art of transitioning between peace and war times within a single day, juggling intense work periods with brief moments of calm.

Customer support is a critical aspect of any business, but handling it 24/7 without any dedicated team has been a massive undertaking. We knew that providing exceptional support right from the start would set us apart from competitors and build a loyal customer base. However, the reality of this commitment meant sleepless nights, constant vigilance, and being available at odd hours to ensure our customers felt valued and heard.

## Battling Health Issues

Compounding the demands of our startup, I faced some health problems during this intense period. These issues weren't a result of burnout but added an extra layer of difficulty to an already challenging time. Despite the physical and mental strain, I had to keep working, tracking customer issues, and managing ongoing tasks. It was an excruciating period, but I pushed through.

Health problems during such a crucial time can be particularly taxing. The physical symptoms were hard to ignore—fatigue, headaches, and a general sense of malaise. Mentally, I felt drained and unmotivated, a stark contrast to the enthusiasm I usually have for development work. These days were a battle between my body's demand for rest and the relentless pace of startup life. I had to find ways to stay engaged and productive, even when my energy levels were at their lowest.

## Finding Relief

Cooling down from this intense phase didn't have a straightforward solution. I took time to walk outside, spend quality moments with my wife, and deliberately shift my focus away from work. For a decade, my primary hobby has been coding—an activity that usually brings me joy but also posed a risk of further burnout, so I paused it for a week.

Walking became a simple yet effective escape. The physical activity helped clear my mind, and being in nature provided a much-needed break from screens and code. Spending time with my wife was invaluable. She has been my rock throughout this journey, and those moments of connection reminded me of the importance of balancing personal and professional life. Shifting my focus away from work, even briefly, helped me recharge and gain perspective on the broader picture.

## Embracing a Healthier Routine

Recognizing the need for a sustainable lifestyle, I decided to start meditating, improving my diet, and incorporating daily exercise into my routine. The positive impact of these changes has been remarkable, and I can't believe how much better I feel.

Meditation has been a game-changer. It provides a structured way to calm my mind and reduce stress, which has been essential in maintaining focus and clarity throughout the day. Improving my diet was another crucial step. Opting for nutritious, balanced meals over quick, convenient options has made a noticeable difference in my energy levels and overall well-being. Incorporating daily exercise has not only improved my physical health but also served as a mental reset, breaking up the day and providing a healthy outlet for stress.

## Ready to Relaunch

As we approach Monday, I feel rejuvenated and ready to tackle new challenges with renewed energy and focus. The journey has been tough, but it's also been incredibly rewarding. With the lessons learned and a healthier lifestyle in place, I am more prepared than ever to drive liftOS forward.

This period of reflection and adjustment has been crucial. It reminded me that while the startup life is demanding, it is also important to take care of oneself to sustain long-term productivity and happiness. As we continue to grow liftOS, I look forward to embracing both the highs and the lows, equipped with the knowledge and practices to maintain balance and thrive.

## Conclusion

The life of an entrepreneur is a constant balancing act between professional demands and personal well-being. While the road is fraught with challenges, taking steps to care for oneself is crucial. For me, the support of family, a shift in daily habits, and a conscious effort to find moments of peace amidst the chaos have been key to staying resilient. As we continue to grow liftOS, I look forward to embracing both the highs and the lows, equipped with the knowledge and practices to maintain balance and thrive. The journey ahead is undoubtedly filled with challenges, but with the right strategies and support systems in place, I'm confident that we can navigate them successfully.
